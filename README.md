# jquery-shadeArea

This is a small and simple jQuery plugin I wrote just so I could darken an area of the browser window behind the selected elements, usually DIVs. 

## Usage

$(selector).shadeArea({
	color: black,
	opacity: 0.7
});

Change "selector" for your jQuery selector.

The "color" parameter can be any valid color used in CSS.

The "opacity" parameter should be a decimal between 0.0 and 1.0

I have only quickly written this for a specific project, there are likely to be issues.
